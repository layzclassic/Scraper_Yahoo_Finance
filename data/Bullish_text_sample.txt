Hello from Europe. Nothing is happening with Russia. It happens that the world's largest power, the USA, wants the EU to buy expensive USA gas instead of cheap Russian gas.
I feel sorry for the Ukrainians who now live in fear but they are just victims of big games.
The world's largest power is also a superpower in the field of information. So they spread the story through the media that the war has just begun. And in reality there is none of that. In the end, the same media will tell you how Russia gave in under NATO pressure, even if the real danger of war did not exist. WIN WIN SITUATION FOR USA. Usa is the world's greatest power and they are GREAT MASTERS OF FOREIGN POLICY. Take the opportunity to buy cheap stocks. Buy when everyone is scared and sell when everyone buys!
Morewhy do you think that wish cannot return $24 before the end of the year? or earlier? after all, she was able to fall from these figures in six months, which means that she can return it in the same way, nothing is impossibleI saw their Valentine ads on Tiktok and Instagram and like them. So I bought 5k shares yesterday just in time for the uptrend today. Plan to buy more shares later.In the name of the father son and of the holy spirt please short squeeze to the moon !Wish at $20 within 12 months..this is just the startWish will be over $32-$64 within 2-3 years and $128+in 5.Look, everyone knows Wish sells cheap stuff, so do dollar stores and people love them!Still only 80% down,can we do this everyday üòÜ!Wish clips!Wish is a once in a lifetime opportunity.Wallstreetbets Wish short squeeze is coming.On February 10, 2022, JPMorgancase announced the sale of all PUT options, increasing its equity position in return.
Reference: A put option is a contract that gives the owner of a financial instrument the right to sell assets at a predetermined price at a predetermined time. It is similar to a short position in stock trading. The trader also has the right to sell the contract before the agreed time if the market situation has changed.

MoreThere's good news going on with wish. Everybody is excited.Why did this jump today? Simply, it‚Äôs grossly undervalued in a bloated Market. Look at the cash on hand, the revenues, and current valuation. You‚Äôll get your answer.If you really think that Russia will attack Ukraine, go to the bookmaker and ask how much they will offer you for such a bet? It will give you $ 5 per investment. And then ask how much they offer you if you bet there will be no attack? You get $ 1.10 on 1 bet. Imagine Russia occupying Ukraine, what did they get? Sanctions from around the world. And Ukraine has nothing that Russia needs. Russia has all the gas, oil, ore and Ukraine does not. And then what to do with 40 million Ukrainians? Buy stocks while everyone panics for no reason. Buy when everyone is scared and sell when everyone buys! Warren Buffett.
MoreWish is worth ipo price $24 with steady growth much moreWish clips, it's a start, in the right direction. I've already have fams asking about wish and seeking to buy stuff.If you see negative news, then you need to buy. If only good news is heard everywhere, it is necessary to sell. Manipulate the market like thisThe fall in prices due to the Russia-Ukraine crisis is ridiculous. As someone who is tied to Russia on business, I can only say that the phrase Russia is attacking Ukraine is a fabrication of the USA-UK, in order to sharpen the relations between Russia and Ukraine. Divide and Conquer. There will be no war. Take advantage of the fear of buying cheap stocks. Buy when everyone is scared and sell when everyone buys! Woren Buffett.Wish is showing a lot of support here over the past month, building a solid base. What was once a risky investment is looking pretty good for a comfortable entry point here.Good news tomorrow! $3+
Good luck!$1 is imminent ! I will buy from there !Wish's percentage of shorted shares keeps on dropping and institutions keep adding more shares.As an excellent connoisseur of the Russian-Ukrainian problem, I guarantee you that there is no chance that Russia will attack Ukraine. This tension suits the interests of the USA and that is all. Maybe because the EU starts buying more expensive gas, oil and raw materials from the USA? Imagine Russia occupying Ukraine! And then what to do with 40 million people? They would get sanctions from all over the world. Putin is wise, not crazy. He will never do that. It's like the USA is occupying Mexico. What do they need that for? And then what? Ukraine has no raw materials, oil, gas ... Russia has it all. What would occupy Ukraine then? TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUY CHEAP ACTIONS WHILE EVERYONE IS SCARED AND PRICES ARE LOW!
MoreWish is going to trade sideways until we see input from Talwar on the strategy and what by when in terms of return to revenue/MAU growth and break even. There has been no meaningful news other than naming Talwar as CEO and Jackie stepping down from the board. Actions show that wish continues to execute on the plan by setting up merchants as invite only, wish clips, and continuing to hire/fill open requisitions. The key takeaways from the 13F due 2/15/22 from Q4 2021 is that:

1)institutional ownership increased 20%+ from 28.9% to 35.9%
2) Vanguard means business and added another 1 million shares to their cache
3) Two sigma(hedge fund quant firm with algos) upped their stake by 400% to 5.8 million shares while Renaissance capital closed their position

This should not be a determining factor for investing but should be part of your overall due diligence. Bashers have an agenda just like HF have an agenda and wait till the last day to file. These guys do not want to be transparent because it might actually help retail. Downside is limited but inflation and Ukraine will be a narrative smart money will leverage for the first part of 2022 to keep this between $1.80 and $3. Long and strong.
MoreWe are coming into a long holiday weekend in the states. Volume was already low with only 8 million non-synthetic shares traded yesterday.

MoreWish is up almost 30% in the past few days. A little pullback is to be expected and actually quite healthy for the long term trend upward that has begun.Institutions holders increased by 6 in one week 180 to 186Wen Lambo??Why WISH stock could double! Trading at $2.40 a share early Monday, January 31st, there is no question WISH is a cheaply priced stock. WISH can be compared to Amazon and Overstock. Earnings report for this past Holiday season should show big growth. People who buy in now, could see their positions double and more. I am bullish on this start-up internet retail company that has a platform for huge potential success and upside. WISH will be thriving over the next few years as more companies add their products to its already huge success.

The other day, I was watching a cooking show and the chef referenced WISH‚Äôs website as being a place where he bought some products that he‚Äôs using on the show. I am VERY bullish on WISH.

People are going to realized it was a mistake not buying at these prices, Yes! I was fooled and purchased high but looking at the intrinsic value of this stock, it made no sense not to stay on board. The reality is, I shop on wish, aside from the extra few days I have to wait for the product. There's a lot of sexy products that Amazon doesn't have at a lower cost. Good luck longs.My dear brothers & sisters whoever invested on this, I have a question to ask you. How many times you heard people saying, ‚ÄúI should have kept this stock, I should have kept that stock. Then I could have make lots of money today.‚Äù Probably so many times you also did that but don‚Äôt do it this time. I know it‚Äôs taking our so much patience but guess what!
