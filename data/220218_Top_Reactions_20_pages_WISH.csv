2,2,David,8,,Bullish,"Hello from Europe. Nothing is happening with Russia. It happens that the world's largest power, the USA, wants the EU to buy expensive USA gas instead of cheap Russian gas.
I feel sorry for the Ukrainians who now live in fear but they are just victims of big games.
The world's largest power is also a superpower in the field of information. So they spread the story through the media that the war has just begun. And in reality there is none of that. In the end, the same media will tell you how Russia gave in under NATO pressure, even if the real danger of war did not exist. WIN WIN SITUATION FOR USA. Usa is the world's greatest power and they are GREAT MASTERS OF FOREIGN POLICY. Take the opportunity to buy cheap stocks. Buy when everyone is scared and sell when everyone buys!

There has been no meaningful news other than naming Talwar as CEO and Jackie stepping down from the board. Actions show that wish continues to execute on the plan by setting up merchants as invite only, wish clips, and continuing to hire/fill open requisitions. The key takeaways from the 13F due 2/15/22 from Q4 2021 is that:

1)institutional ownership increased 20%+ from 28.9% to 35.9%
2) Vanguard means business and added another 1 million shares to their cache
3) Two sigma(hedge fund quant firm with algos) upped their stake by 400% to 5.8 million shares while Renaissance capital closed their position

This should not be a determining factor for investing but should be part of your overall due diligence. Bashers have an agenda just like HF have an agenda and wait till the last day to file. These guys do not want to be transparent because it might actually help retail. Downside is limited but inflation and Ukraine will be a narrative smart money will leverage for the first part of 2022 to keep this between $1.80 and $3. Long and strong.

I have a choice to pull out and take the 250k loss completely and put the rest on a rental down payment, and get the 250 back in 5-7 years, in value, or to average down and go for the same 1.5-2 m in cash and not be stuck with a rock building rental.

347,347,Hershee,4,4,,"Let‚Äôs be serious here. People need to stop comparing Wish to Amazon. Amazon pioneered e-commerceÔøº and went through every up and down to become who they are today. If Wish couldn‚Äôt learn from Amazon‚Äòs history then they don‚Äôt belong in the game. People talk like they‚Äôve found a gold mine here when in fact they‚Äôve found a complete failure. Nothing can really save this company other than maybe a buyout with a name change. In my opinion they should just dissolve the company or let it go bankrupt. There‚Äôs so many other up-and-coming e-commerce companies that have a way better chance of competing against Amazon and becoming a successful e-commerce company. The Wish name-brand has been tainted because of it‚Äôs terrible reputation Ôøºand nothing can change that.

For companies that have on average been loss making in the past we assess whether they have at least 1 year of cash runway.
Stable Cash Runway: WISH has sufficient cash runway for more than a year based on its current free cash flow.
